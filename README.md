# Chrome Extension React

Run `npm run start`

Load your extension on Chrome following:

    1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
    2. Check `Developer mode`
    3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
    4. Select the `build` folder.
    
Have fun.

## Content Scripts

Although this boilerplate uses the webpack dev server, it's also prepared to write all your bundles files on the disk at every code change, so you can point, on your extension manifest, to your bundles that you want to use as [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), but you need to exclude these entry points from hot reloading [(why?)](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/issues/4#issuecomment-261788690). To do so you need to expose which entry points are content scripts on the `webpack.config.js` using the `chromeExtensionBoilerplate -> notHotReload` config. Look the example below.

Let's say that you want use the `myContentScript` entry point as content script, so on your `webpack.config.js` you will configure the entry point and exclude it from hot reloading, like this:

```js
{
  …
  entry: {
    myContentScript: "./src/js/myContentScript.js"
  },
  chromeExtensionBoilerplate: {
    notHotReload: ["myContentScript"]
  }
  …
}
```

and on your `src/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*"],
      "js": ["myContentScript.bundle.js"]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Packing
After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```
Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.


## With React.js
:bulb: If you want use [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) with this boilerplate, check the **[react branch](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/tree/react)**.

## ESLINT

Check if eslint enabled in your IDE to save code style
